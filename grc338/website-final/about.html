            <h2> About Us</h2>
            <p> Hello and welcome to Kaley's Kupcakes! </p>
            <p> My name is Kaley and I am the founder and owner of this small, but growing cupcake business. Baking has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember, and I've always loved experimenting with new flavors and designs.
               After years of making cupcakes for family and friends, I decided to turn my hobby into a business. It's been an incredible journey so far, and I'm so grateful for all of the support I've received along the way. 
            </p>

               All of our cupcakes are made with the freshest, highest-quality ingredients, and we take pride in offering a variety of flavors to suit every taste. Some of our most popular flavors include classic vanilla, rich chocolate, and tangy lemon, but we're always coming up with new and exciting creations.
            <p> In addition to our classic flavors, we also offer seasonal specialties, custom designs, and gluten-free options. We believe that everyone deserves to enjoy a delicious cupcake, no matter their dietary restrictions.
